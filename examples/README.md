# Examples

* `los`: Examples on how to render images using Mitsuba 3 (for more info on Mitsuba 3 [watch this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCsjK6Cbv6Q) or [read the docs](https://mitsuba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)), and how to render the same scene in transient state or steady state.
* `nlos`: Example on how to render NLOS simulations from the Python interface. For easier setups you can also check [tal](https://github.com/diegoroyo/tal), a Python library with a shell interface that simplifies this process.
* `old`: Undocumented examples/scenes which may not work now.
